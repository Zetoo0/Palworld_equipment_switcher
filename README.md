A fast switcher between equipments, because you can only switch with scrolls in Palworld.
Keys: Z-U-I-O, but you can change them in the source code, but the future me want to do it with a better solution plus maybe I'll create a mod later.

How to use:
You have to "initialize" on start, scroll to your first equipment and press Z, after then it will work.

Sorry for the kinda bad solution, I just wanted to do it quick for personal use.
